        <div class="item-title">Chicken</div>
        <p>Get ready for chicken that’s cluckin’ incredible! We’ve taken this humble bird and transformed it into a dish so juicy, so crispy, and so perfectly seasoned it practically wrote its own fan club anthem. So many mouthwatering styles it should have its own runway show.</p>

        <div class="item-title">Beef</div>
        <p>Our beef dishes are so tender, so juicy, and so packed with flavor that you’ll think we’ve unlocked some sort of secret beef wizardry. Whether it’s a steak that’s charred to smoky perfection or slow-cooked beef that falls apart just by looking at it, this is meat magic at its finest.</p>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-title">Sushi</div>
        <p>Mouthwatering, hand-crafted, sea-sourced perfection that’s so fresh it might still have an ocean address. Picture crispy tempura crunches, creamy avocado hugs, and the kind of fresh fish that whispers "eat me" in a seductive tone. These little rice-wrapped masterpieces are so good.</p>
